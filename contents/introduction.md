## What is Pantarei?

Pantarei is a JavaScript Web framework for building user interfaces.  
Unlike other opinionated frameworks, it is designed to be resilient.  
The core library is focused on the view layer only.  
When used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries,  
it's perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications.

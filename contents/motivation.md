# Motivation

There is no task in software engineering today quite as herculean as web development.  
To tackle the problem of building interactive interfaces for the Web platform,  
the web development community has evolved a vast ecosystem of Web frameworks.

Nowadays there are plents of Web Framework that can be choosen for a new web project,  
many are incredible feats of engineering, and quickly became extraordinarily popular,  
while others take care of their own niche, everyone pursuing its own interests.

Choosing a web framework is typically the first major technological decision in a new web project.  
Web frameworks tend to be overarching in every parts of the project, leading to lock-in from day one.  
They are so challenging to migrate off of, that choosing to change means to start from scratch.

Moreover, web application requirements and device and browser capabilities are constantly evolving,    
so rapidly that the tools, libraries and web framework as well must evolve rapidly to keep up,  
while the web development community is constantly craving the next new thing.

Pantarei is designed to be flexible, lightweight, and close to the web platform.  
The library doesn't invent complex new abstractions and magic,  
but uses the best emerging features of the web platform, such as Web Components.

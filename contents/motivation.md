# Motivation

## TL;DR

Existing frameworks tend to be overarching and to lead to lock-in from day one.  
A light, customizable, modular, extensible, Web Framework is required.
A resilient, close to the platform Web Framework is needed. Enter Pantarei.

## Web Frameworks

There is no task in software engineering today quite as herculean as web development.  
To tackle the problem of building attractive, interactive user interfaces for the Web,  
the web development community has evolved a vast ecosystem of web frameworks.

In system design, a frameworks is a fundamental structure for supporting or enclosing something else.  
Web frameworks provide a standard way to build complex web applications, as well as simple static websites.  
Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development.  

Nowadays there are plenty of web frameworks that can be chosen for a new web project,  
some are incredible feats of engineering, becoming quickly extraordinarily popular,  
others take care of their own niche as well, everyone pursuing its own interests.

Choosing a web framework is typically the first major technological decision in a new web project.  
Choosing a framework is usually the main decision that could strongly influence the overall system design.  
A framework is not just a mere technology, a framework expresses a design philosophy.

Web frameworks tend to be overarching in every parts of the project, leading to lock-in from day one.  
Migrating off from a framework, or sometimes even upgrading a framework, is so challanging,  
that usually choosing to switch to another framework means to start from scratch the entire project.

However, thinking of not changing, or even not upgrading, wouldnâ€™t simply reflect the reality.  
Web application requirements and device and browser capabilities are constantly evolving,  
and the web development community is constantly craving the next new thing.

## Introducing Pantarei

Pantarei is designed to be flexible, lightweight, and close to the web platform.  
The library doesn't invent complex new abstractions and magic,  
but uses the best emerging features of the web platform, such as Web Components.

Pantarei is a tiny foundation for building user interfaces for the Web.
